    <string name="hamlet">The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet,
        is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601. It is Shakespeare\'s
        longest play, with 30,557 words. Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his
        revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet\'s father in order to seize his
        throne and marry Hamlet\'s mother.<br/>
        Hamlet is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature,
        with a story capable of "seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others".
        It was one of Shakespeare\'s most popular works during his lifetime and still ranks among his
        most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its
        predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879.
        It has inspired many other writers—from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to
        James Joyce and Iris Murdoch—and has been described as "the world\'s most filmed story after Cinderella".
        The story of Shakespeare\'s Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by
        13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by the
        16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier
        Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe Shakespeare
        wrote the Ur-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet that exists today.
        He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor,
        Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare\'s time. In the 400 years since its
        inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century.
        Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603);
        the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623).
        Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others.
        The play\'s structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny.
        One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet\'s hesitation to kill his uncle,
        which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action but which others argue is a
        dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder,
        calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined
        Hamlet\'s unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to
        rehabilitate the often-maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.</string>
